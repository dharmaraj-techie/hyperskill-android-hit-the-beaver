<h2>Description</h2>

<p>You are going to visually spice things up in our game with five images. First of all, you will add an active image, which will let the user know they should click on the image. Then, you will add an inactive image which will let the user know the image is not currently active and that clicking on it won't do anything. Finally, a successful image will be displayed each time the user successfully clicks&nbsp;on the active image.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You want the images you added to the project to behave like buttons. We can do that by adding an <code>ImageButton</code> element. You will set all the buttons to inactive at first.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Add action to start new <code>Activity</code>.&nbsp;When the user clicks on the <code>Next</code> button, the game screen will now appear.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The name of the game screen activity must be <code>GameScreenActivity</code></li>

	<li>Add five&nbsp;<code>ImageButton</code>&nbsp;.&nbsp;You can download all images for your project game <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1o0jgIh8gvxTPdIj4DlJVjVYX7KSfmBzN?usp=sharing" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>User interface should now have images on both the top and bottom of our screen.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Great! This is how images look now.&nbsp; <span style="color: #a03881;">&nbsp;</span></p>
