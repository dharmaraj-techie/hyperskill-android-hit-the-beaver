<h2>Description</h2>

<p>At this stage, we will check the correctness of the input. The user should not enter a too long nickname to make it easier for others&nbsp;to recognize it. Therefore, you can add a restriction and a notification so that the user understands that he entered something wrong.</p>

<p>If the user enters a value that you don't want to accept, you can show a pop-up <code>Toast</code> that displays an error.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Add <code>Toast</code> which says "Enter a valid name" when the user enters incorrect value.
		The value must be text only and must be between length 1 and 9.</li>
	<li>Add a function to begin Game, if the user enters a valid name. the name of the function must be <code>beginGame</code>. when that function gets called it should show a Toast saying "Begin Game".
	for testing please make the method <code>public</code> </li>
</ol>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Excellent! You will soon have a great game on hands.<span style="color: #a03881;">&nbsp;</span></p>
